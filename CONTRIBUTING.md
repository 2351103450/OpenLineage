# Contributing Guide

## Reporting an Issue

Please use the [issues][issues] section of the OpenLineage repository and search for a similar problem. If you don't find it, submit your bug, question, proposal or feature request.

In the case of bugs, please provide steps to reproduce it and tag your issue with "bug"

## Creating Pull Requests

Before sending a Pull Request with significant changes, please use the [issue tracker][issues] to discuss the potential improvements you want to make.

## Proposing changes

Create an issue and prefix the description with "[PROPOSAL]"

In the description provide the following sections:
 - Purpose (Why?): What is the use case this is for. 
 - Proposed implementation (How?): Quick description of how do you propose to implement it. Are you proposing a new facet?

This can be just a couple paragraphs to start with.

## First-Time Contributors

If this is your first contribution to open source, you can [follow this tutorial][contributiontutorial] or check [this video series][contributionvideos] to learn about the contribution workflow with GitHub.

Look tickets labeled ['good first issue'][goodfirstissues] and ['help wanted'][helpwantedissues]. These are a great starting point if you want to contribute. Don't hesitate to ask questions about the issue if you are not sure about the strategy to follow.
